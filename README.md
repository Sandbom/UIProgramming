Usage of the flying dutchman website:
On every page the user can choose to change the language displayed on the website by pressing the corresponding flag to the language.The languages available is Swedish, English, Greek and German. The user also has a button to be able to login, as of right now the login simply logs in a token user named "Johan" to show how the system would work. The user, in this case Johan then receives an icon showing that he is logged in. On the top bar we also feature a way for the user to go back to a previous page as well a button for going back to the welcome page. 
When launchin the website the user is taken to a welcome page from here the user can choose to browse the available beers. After pressing the button he/she is redirected to a page where the user can choose which sort of beer they want to browse, the four available categories of beer are: Light lager, Porter and stout, Ale and Dark lager. After pressing one of these categories the user is then redirected to a page displaying 25 beers of that category. On this page the user can drag the beers displayed in the list and drop them in a cart. After dropping a beer in the cart the beer is displayed there as well as the total sum of all beers added. When the user has selected and drag n dropped all the beers he/she wants there is a button "Cart" which takes the user to a cart page where all the chosen beers are displayed and there is a button for paying, after pressing the pay button and "paying" for the beer a thank you message is displayed.
